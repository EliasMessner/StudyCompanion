    "             \"AI systems pose several challenges to traditional requirements engineering. Some of these challenges include: Missing oracle: Unlike traditional software systems, AI systems often lack a ground truth or a trustworthy tool to define the correctness criteria for system outputs. This makes it difficult to establish clear requirements and evaluate the system's performance. Imperfection: AI systems are not 100% accurate. They may make errors or provide suboptimal results, which can complicate the process of defining requirements that ensure desired levels of accuracy and reliability. Uncertainty of untested data: AI systems may behave unpredictably when faced with unseen or untested data. This uncertainty makes it challenging to anticipate how the system will perform in real-world scenarios and raises concerns about its robustness and generalization capabilities. High dependency on training data: The behavior of AI systems is highly dependent on the data used for training. This means that even small changes in the training data can lead to significant variations in system behavior. Defining requirements becomes complex when the desired behavior is not formally specified but instead emerges from the training process. These challenges give rise to some typical characteristics of AI systems, including erosion of determinism, unpredictability, and unexplainability of individual outputs. Traditional requirements engineering approaches may need to be adapted or supplemented to address these unique challenges posed by AI systems.\",\n",

Transparency and Explainability: AI systems should be designed in a way that their decision-making process is transparent and explainable. Users should be able to understand how and why an AI system arrived at a particular decision or recommendation. 2. Fairness and Bias Mitigation: AI systems should be developed and deployed in a manner that avoids unfair discrimination and reduces biases. They should not favor or disadvantage certain individuals or groups based on factors such as race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or other protected attributes. 3. Privacy and Data Protection: AI systems must respect and protect the privacy of individuals. They should handle personal data securely and only use it for the intended purposes. Users' consent should be obtained for collecting and processing their data, and appropriate measures should be in place to safeguard sensitive information.4. Accountability and Responsibility: Developers and deployers of AI systems should take responsibility for their creations. They should be accountable for the outcomes and impacts of AI systems, and mechanisms should be in place to address any unintended consequences or harm caused by the technology. 5. Human Oversight and Control: AI systems should be designed to ensure that humans retain ultimate control and decision-making authority. Humans should be able to intervene, override, or modify the decisions made by AI systems, particularly in critical or sensitive domains. 6. Robustness and Safety: AI systems should be developed with a focus on robustness and safety. They should be tested and evaluated thoroughly to ensure that they perform reliably and do not pose risks to human lives, well-being, or the environment. 7. Ethical Use and Purpose Limitation: AI systems should only be used for ethical purposes and within the boundaries defined by applicable laws and regulations. They should not be deployed to engage in harmful, malicious, or deceptive activities. These examples highlight some key ethical requirements for AI systems.

    "             \"A perceptron is the simplest form of an artificial neural network. It is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of biological neurons. The perceptron consists of input nodes, weights assigned to each input, a summation function, an activation function, and an output. It takes a set of inputs, multiplies them by their respective weights, and sums them up. The sum is then passed through an activation function to produce an output. The activation function used in a perceptron is typically a step function, which outputs a binary value based on whether the summed input exceeds a threshold. If the summed input is above the threshold, the perceptron outputs one value (usually representing a positive class), and if it is below the threshold, it outputs another value (usually representing a negative class). The weights in a perceptron are initially assigned randomly and are updated during the learning process. The perceptron learning algorithm adjusts the weights based on the errors made by the perceptron in classifying training examples. The algorithm aims to find the optimal set of weights that allows the perceptron to correctly classify the inputs. While the perceptron is limited to solving linearly separable problems, it was significant in the development of neural networks. It laid the foundation for more complex neural network architectures, such as multi-layer perceptrons, which consist of multiple layers of interconnected perceptrons. Backpropagation, an algorithm for training neural networks, is based on the principles introduced by the perceptron learning algorithm.\",\n",
    "             \"The unit step function, also known as the Heaviside step function, is a discontinuous function that takes the value of 1 for positive input values and 0 for negative input values. It poses challenges when used as an activation function for backpropagation in neural networks due to two main reasons: 1. Non-differentiability: The unit step function is non-differentiable almost everywhere, except at the point of discontinuity. The derivative of the unit step function is either 0 or undefined at all points except the threshold. Backpropagation relies on calculating derivatives to update the weights and optimize the network. Since the derivative of the unit step function is zero or undefined for most inputs, it becomes impossible to calculate meaningful gradients and perform effective weight updates using backpropagation. 2. Unstable learning: The unit step function is highly discontinuous, causing abrupt changes in output values with small changes in input. This discontinuity can lead to instability in the learning process of neural networks. As backpropagation relies on making small adjustments to the weights based on the error gradients, the step function's binary nature makes it challenging to converge to an optimal solution. The small weight adjustments made through gradient descent are not effective in reducing the error, as the step function remains constant until a certain threshold is crossed. To address these issues, activation functions that are differentiable and have non-zero gradients over most of their domain are preferred for backpropagation. Popular choices include sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent (tanh), and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions. These functions allow for smooth transitions and continuous changes in the output, enabling effective weight updates during backpropagation and stable learning in neural networks.\",\n",
    "             \"A universal approximator refers to a mathematical function or model that can closely approximate any continuous function within a given domain. It is capable of approximating arbitrary functions on a compact subset of the input space. This concept is often used in the context of deep neural networks. The notion of universal approximators dates back to Hilbert's 13th conjecture, which he presented in the Second International Congress of Mathematicians in 1900. In the context of neural networks, the idea of being a universal approximator means that a neural network can approximate any continuous function if it has a sufficient number of parameters or neurons. This property is one of the key factors contributing to the success of deep neural networks. Being a universal approximator implies that a neural network can learn complex mappings between inputs and outputs. It enables neural networks to generalize from observed instances and make predictions for new instances accurately. For example, in an image classification task using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the network can learn to classify images based on their pixel values. The network's output would be a numerical class label, such as 1 for dogs and 0 for cats. The universal approximator property does not guarantee prediction accuracy or convergence. However, it provides a theoretical foundation for the effectiveness of neural networks in learning and representing complex functions.\",\n",
    "             \"Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist. He is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Turing made significant contributions to various fields, including cryptography and code-breaking during World War II. One of Turing's most famous achievements was his concept of a universal computing machine, known as the 'Turing machine.' This theoretical device laid the foundation for the development of modern computers. The Turing machine is a simple model that can simulate the logic of any computer algorithm and is used in the study of computability and complexity theory. During World War II, Turing worked at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, where he played a crucial role in deciphering encrypted German messages. His work on breaking the Enigma code, used by the German military, is believed to have shortened the war and saved countless lives. Despite his significant contributions, Turing's life was marred by tragedy. He was openly gay at a time when homosexuality was criminalized in the United Kingdom. In 1952, he was prosecuted for homosexual acts and subjected to chemical castration as an alternative to imprisonment. Turing died in 1954 at the age of 41, and his death was ruled as suicide, although there has been ongoing debate about the circumstances.In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of Turing's contributions and the injustice he faced. In 2013, Turing received a posthumous royal pardon, and his story has been widely celebrated for his pioneering work and the impact he had on modern computing and cryptography.\",\n",

Das Arbeitsband ist beidseitig unbeschränkt und besteht aus einzelnen Zellen, die mit Symbolen beschriftet werden können. Die endliche Kontrolle steuert die Aktionen der Maschine, basierend auf ihrem aktuellen Zustand und dem Symbol, das der Lese-/Schreibkopf auf dem Band liest. Die Turing-Maschine kann verschiedene Operationen durchführen, wie das Lesen eines Symbols, das Schreiben eines Symbols, das Bewegen des Lese-/Schreibkopfs nach links oder rechts und das Wechseln des aktuellen Zustands.

      "##################################\n",
      "What I did If you’re not familiar with Midjourney, it’s one of the most prominent models in AI image generation to date.\n",
      "\n",
      "I experimented with the model to see how well it could produce a unique series of graphics for a new brand identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the results: How I did it While the exercise was more of a test, I learned some valuable insights along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s go through the process together.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "Defining your graphic criteria When defining a style, first identify and build upon unique visual characteristics or themes that your graphics should embody.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this brand, let’s explore a style that captures the ideas of 3D momentum and luminous color blending.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s helpful to reference existing inspiration you either found online or captured personally.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compiling the inspiration into buckets will form a clearer frame of reference and later become useful as Midjourney inputs.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "In our case, I have already designed the logo and color palette.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s important that the new graphics are closely aligned and work together as a unified system.\n",
      "\n",
      "By abstracting the characteristics of the logo and color palette (seen above), we can help guide a more on-brand image result in Midjourney.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now that we’ve identified both the graphic inspiration and brand asset imagery, it’s time to take them both into Midjourney.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "Blending in Midjourney While most of us are familiar with the /imagine command, I personally feel it is not as powerful when working toward a very specific visual outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our case, we’ll use the /blend command.\n",
      "\n",
      "This command “blends” multiple images together and generates an image somewhere in between.\n",
      "\n",
      "By typing /blend + (Return) into the Discord message box, the above drag-and-drop modules will appear.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "While Midjourney allows the blending of up to 5 images at once, I recommend sticking with 2–3 images, as this provides greater design control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now it’s playtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s upload our image inputs to the drag-and-drop modules.\n",

      "Here are some various combinations I had explored: It looks like one of the results above needs additional refining.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "As an example, we’ll choose to re-blend this image result: We’ll re-blend this image with another in hopes it will bring the result closer to what we’re looking for: There.\n",
      "\n",
      "Repeating this process will help to grow a library of images with one cohesive style.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, here’s where I landed: I also created some other interesting styles along the way: 3.\n",

      "Rather, it’s to showcase an example of AI’s power applied to design.\n",

      "\n",
      "You can upscale options using the command U[number].\n",

      "In practice, this is difficult to achieve as stakeholders interpret the requirements in different ways and there are often inherent conflicts and inconsistencies in the requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we’ve mentioned before, the process in requirements engineering is interleaved, and it’s done iteratively.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first iteration you specify the user requirements, then, specify a more detailed system requirement.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "User Requirements The user requirements for a system should describe the functional and non-functional requirements so that they are understandable by users who don’t have technical knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should write user requirements in natural language supplied by simple tables, forms, and intuitive diagrams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The requirement document shouldn’t include details of the system design, and you shouldn’t use any software jargon or formal notations.\n",

      "System Requirements The system requirements on the other hand are an expanded version of the user requirements that are used by software engineers as the starting point for the system design.\n",
      "\n",
      "They add detail and explain how the user requirements should be provided by the system.\n",

      "##################################\n",
      "The system requirements may also be written in natural language but other ways based on structured forms, or graphical notations are usually used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ways of Writing Requirements Specification As we’ve mentioned, there are different ways to specify the requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most two common ways are natural and structured languages.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "Software Engineering, 9th edition, Chapter 4, by Ian Sommerville Natural Language Specification It’s a way of writing the requirements in normal plain text, there is no defined format by default.\n",
      "\n",
      "Requirements written in natural language are vague and ambiguous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hence, you need to follow these guidelines to minimize the consequences and misunderstanding: Create your own format for writing the requirements.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "For example, you can write the requirements in this format: “A/The (Actor) shall (do something), By (how; explain how the user can trigger this feature), In order to/so that (why; explain the benefits or the objects of this requirement).\n",
      "\n",
      "Example: “A system shall allow the users to register by entering their username and password, In order to get an access to the system”.\n",
      "##################################\n",

      "Structured Language Specification It’s a way of writing the requirements in a more formal and structured form.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "It uses standard templates to specify the requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "The specification can be structured around the functions or events performed by the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Software Engineering, 9th edition, Chapter 4, by Ian Sommerville Software Requirements Document The software requirements document (also called software requirements specification or SRS) is an official document of what should be implemented.\n",

      "##################################\n",

      "\n",
      "Usually, the user requirements are defined in an introduction to the system requirements.\n",

      "\n",
      "Software Engineering, 9th edition, Chapter 4, by Ian Sommerville The requirement document has a diverse set of users, ranging from the customers to the system engineers.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "The diversity of possible users means that the requirements document has to be a compromise between communicating the requirements to customers, defining the requirements in detail for developers and testers, and information about predicted changes can help system designers to avoid restrictive design decisions, and help the system maintenance engineers to adapt the system to new requirements.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "In agile methods, since the requirements change so rapidly, it’s a waste of time to deliver a full document at once, instead, collects the requirements incrementally, and writes them on cards as user stories.\n",

      "##################################\n",
      "It focuses on assessing if the system is useful to the business (feasibility study), discovering requirements (elicitation and analysis), converting these requirements into some standard format (specification), and checking that the requirements define the system that the customer wants (validation).\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, requirements engineering isn’t sequential process, it’s an iterative process in which activities are interleaved.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "For example, you iterate first on the user requirements; elicitation, specification, and validation, and repeat the same steps for the system requirements.\n",

      "Later in the process, more efforts will be spent on elicitation and understanding detailed system requirements.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "Some people consider requirements engineering to be the process of applying structured analysis method, such as object-oriented analysis.\n",

      "So, user and system requirements just refer to different levels of detail.\n",

      "Iterate, iterate and iterate again.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "By evaluating and reflecting the defined requirements, you will receive further inputs, demands and ideas from your colleagues and clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "All steps — from the identification of the stakeholders, to gathering the requirements to validating them — are gone through as long as all requirements are clearly formulated and understood by the entire project team and the client as well.\n",

      "What’s the benefit of requirements engineering?\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "After all, you probably wonder why you should use the framework of requirements engineering in your next project?\n",
      "\n",
      "At the first glance, requirements engineering looks kind of similar to the waterfall model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting by collecting all your requirements, followed by a project concept and planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further on you develop first wireframes and design draft, followed by the coding and implementation.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "However, requirements engineering is more than that and suits perfectly for an agile project management.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast to the waterfall model, all requirements are gathered, defined and evaluated in the requirements engineering technique at the beginning of each sprint.\n",
      "\n",
      "This offers you a higher flexibility on the one hand and prevents conflicts and last minute changes on the other hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which tools to use for requirements engineering?\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "There are all kind of different tools and systems for requirements engineering available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of them offer a comprehensive and powerful set of features.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, these tools seem to be too complex for many web projects we are working in.\n",
      "\n",
      "From our point of view, Google Docs is a perfect fit for the documentation part of your requirements engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you can share your documents easily among colleagues and clients and work together on requirement updates.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "Further web- and browser-based tools like Asana, Basecamp or Trello help you to plan and manage web projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "These tools are easy-to-use and work well with further 3rd party integrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "And most important: your clients will make like them too, because of their nice and comfortable user interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s next?\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementing requirements engineering in your web development team isn’t that complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, it’s important to choose the right time for setting up this new concept.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "It requires a detailed planning, but offers you new opportunities on improving your web development process by getting rid of unnecessary/inefficient tasks/inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Identifying and evaluating requirements at the start of each new sprint will help you to avoid discussions about new ideas at the end of a web project.\n",
      "\n",
      "And don’t forget that a requirements engineering documentation can help you in your quality assurance and testing activities.\n",
      "##################################\n",
      "A well structured document with all defined requirements will provide you and your customers a great monitoring tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Want to learn more?\n",
      "\n",
      "Books for requirements engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, there are tons of blogs, books and sites out there about requirements engineering.\n",
